# The ccvm guest: a minimal, fast-booting, fully ephemeral NixOS system.
#
# Root is a tmpfs (writable, RAM-backed, discarded on power-off); /nix/store is a
# read-only squashfs image attached as a virtio-blk device. Nothing the guest does
# survives a shutdown — there is no persistent disk anywhere (see CLAUDE.md).
#
# This module is evaluated by lib/mkccvm.nix, which extracts the kernel, initrd,
# store image and toplevel and boots them with a runtime-constructed QEMU command
# line (the workspace share and SSH port are only known at `ccvm` launch time, so
# they cannot be declared here — see the microvm.nix runtime-share trap, CLAUDE.md).

  # the opt-in vmDiskSize encrypted disk instead of tmpfs, so a multi-GB `nix develop` doesn't OOM
  # guest RAM. It must run in the INITRD because /nix/store is neededForBoot — the overlay and its
  # upper are assembled before switch-root, so the post-boot seed service (which LUKS-es the disk
  # for /scratch) runs far too late. Strategy: mount-stacking + fail-open. The declarative tmpfs
  # /nix/.rw-store mounts first (we order After it via RequiresMountsFor); then IF the disk is
  # present we LUKS-format/open/mkfs it and mount it OVER that tmpfs, so the overlay's upperdir lands
  # on disk. Absent disk or ANY failure leaves the tmpfs upper (RAM) untouched — boot never bricks.
  # The LUKS key is generated in initrd /run (tmpfs RAM), never on 9p (host sees only ciphertext,
  # host sees only ciphertext), and shredded right after open. A marker in /run — which systemd preserves across
  # switch-root — tells the post-boot seed service the disk is already open, so it shares the SAME
  # pool for /scratch (binds a subdir) rather than reformatting. pbkdf2 keeps luksFormat fast (the
