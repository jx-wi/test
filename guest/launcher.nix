# Guest-side runtime glue, all driven by the read-only "seed" 9p share the host
# wrapper populates per invocation (/run/ccvm-seed):
#
#   * ccvm-seed.service  — a boot oneshot (root) that mounts the seed, installs the
#     SSH host key + authorized_keys, and mounts the workspace per mode. Doing every
#     privileged mount here (ordered Before=sshd) means the ForceCommand launcher can
#     run completely unprivileged: it only cd's and exec's.
#
#   * ccvm-guest-launch  — the sshd ForceCommand. Reads the seed, cd's to the
#     workspace, and exec's either zsh (debug) or claude with the forwarded args.
