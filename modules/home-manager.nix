        (the API key in the guest environment, /login credentials in tmpfs) off host disk.

        Opt-in network egress allowlist. Empty (default) keeps egress fully OPEN, so the
        agent reaches anything like native `claude` (the deliberate native-mirroring default).
        A non-empty list switches the guest to a DEFAULT-DENY egress firewall that permits only
        these destinations on `egressPorts`, plus DNS — closing the prompt-injection
        exfiltration channel. Entries may be FQDNs, bare IPs, or CIDRs. `api.anthropic.com` is
        always auto-included so auth never breaks. FQDNs are resolved on the host at launch and
        pinned BOTH in the firewall and in the guest's /etc/hosts, so the in-VM resolver returns
        exactly those IPs — round-robin / CDN hosts like `github.com` work for the session. The pin
        is session-static, so a host that rotates ALL its IPs away mid-session can drop out;
        restart, or use a CIDR for hosts that churn hard (e.g. GitHub's ranges at
        api.github.com/meta). See CLAUDE.md, "Egress".
