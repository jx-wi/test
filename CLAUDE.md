# CLAUDE.md

Working agreement for agents and contributors on **ccvm** — run Claude Code in an
ephemeral, RAM-only QEMU microVM with native-terminal fidelity. User docs live in
[README.md](README.md). This file is the authoritative engineering doc: the rules that
must not regress, the rationale behind the settled decisions, and the traps that cost
time to rediscover.

## Repo map

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `flake.nix` | Outputs: `packages.*.ccvm`, `homeModules.default`. |
| `lib/mkccvm.nix` | The builder. Evaluates the guest NixOS system, then bakes its boot artifacts + scalar config into the wrapper via `builtins.replaceStrings` `@TOKENS@`. |
| `wrapper/ccvm.sh` | Host wrapper **template** (the `@TOKEN@` placeholders). Generates throw-away SSH keys, writes the seed, boots QEMU headless, `ssh -tt`s in, traps cleanup. |
| `guest/default.nix` | The microVM NixOS guest (tmpfs root, ro squashfs `/nix/store`). |
| `guest/launcher.nix` | Two units. `ccvm-seed.service` (root oneshot, `Before=sshd`) installs the pinned host key + `authorized_keys` and does every 9p/overlay mount. `ccvm-guest-launch` is the **unprivileged** sshd `ForceCommand` that just `cd`s to the workspace and execs claude (or zsh). |
| `guest/sshd.nix` | Hardened sshd: key-only, no root, single `ForceCommand`. |
| `modules/home-manager.nix` | `programs.ccvm.*` options → installs the command. |
| `tests/` | `host.sh` (CI host-side guarantees via the `CCVM_DRYRUN` hook), `boot.sh`+`stub-claude.sh`+`boot.nix` (local full-boot smoke test), `default.nix` (wires `host.sh` into `nix flake check`). |

## Security invariants — MUST NOT regress

These are the whole point of the project. Treat any change that weakens one as a bug.

**Scope of the boundary.** The trust boundary is QEMU: we assume its device/Virtio isolation
holds, and defend the *host filesystem and the user's credentials* against a (possibly
prompt-injected) agent. Explicitly out of scope: defending the host against a malicious *guest
kernel*, and being a general-purpose VM manager — ccvm builds exactly one guest and boots it one
way. The VM being the boundary is what makes `--dangerously-skip-permissions` safe to opt into
(`writableCwd=false` adds a file-level safety net on top).

**Default posture — what the defaults do and don't stop.** The invariants below stop the host
from being **persisted to or having its credentials written to disk** — they do **not** sandbox
what a prompt-injected agent can **read and send**. Under the native-mirroring defaults (open
egress + `share.*` on), the in-VM agent can read the whole project tree and **exfiltrate it over
open egress** (with `clipboard.images` on, also the host clipboard *image* — never text; see
"Image paste"). What it can NO LONGER read is the host's OAuth login: the `share.*` allowlist
stages only settings/commands/memory, and `.credentials.json` is **excluded by construction** —
claude starts unauthenticated and the user's own in-VM `/login` or API key authenticates it. The
host's **stored** credential never crosses; but once authenticated in-VM, the resulting token lives
in the ephemeral tmpfs `~/.claude` and **is readable by the in-VM agent** (it has to be), so under
open egress it is exfiltratable — same class as the project tree. The out-of-the-box win is
**containment** (no host access beyond CWD, nothing persists) plus **the host login never
auto-crossing** — **not** project-exfiltration resistance, a deliberate DevEx choice. The primary
hardening knob is `egressAllowlist` (default-deny egress), enforced **inside the guest** — so it
only binds a non-root agent. Setting `egressAllowlist` also **auto-drops the agent's sudo** and,
under `nix.enable`, removes the agent from Nix `trusted-users` — both load-bearing: a Nix
trusted-user is root-equivalent (`post-build-hook` runs as root) and would otherwise regain root
to `nft flush` the rules (audit S-1; fixed). To disable all claude config sharing: all `share.*`
false or `CCVM_SHARE_CLAUDE_CONFIG=0`. Keep this distinction accurate — under-stating it turns a
sandbox into a liability.

- **API key never touches disk/argv/kernel-cmdline.** It travels only over the SSH channel
  via `SendEnv`→`AcceptEnv`. Use `SendEnv`, **never** `SetEnv` (SetEnv puts it on the
  remote command line).
- **Host key is pinned.** Ephemeral ed25519 keys per run, `StrictHostKeyChecking=yes`.
  Never disable host-key checking to "make it work."
- **`share.*` allowlist excludes the OAuth credential — airtight by construction.**
  The `share.*` items are the ONLY things staged from `~/.claude` into the seed. The
  credential (`.credentials.json`) is not a `share.*` item and is therefore **never copied
  into the seed** — exclusion is by omission, not by filter. Two defenses reinforce this:
  (1) the per-item `cp -aL` only copies the listed paths, so the credential is never touched;
  (2) a defense-in-depth `find $SEED/claude-config -name .credentials.json -delete` strips
  any nested one that a directory `cp` might drag in. The guest lays staged items into a fresh
  **tmpfs** `~/.claude` at boot. Claude starts unauthenticated; the user's `/login` or API key
  authenticates it ephemerally. This also avoids OAuth refresh-token rotation: the rotated in-VM
  token dies with the tmpfs, leaving the host's stored token valid. Verify:
  `grep -rl '\.credentials\.json' "$SEED"` → zero hits. **`persistClaudeProjects` (opt-in)
  does not change this:** it mounts only `~/.claude/projects` read-write; the credential lives
  at the `~/.claude` *root*. Never widen the writable mount to all of `~/.claude`.
- **`~/.claude.json` is staged SANITIZED — its known secret-bearing keys are stripped.** The
  home-root `~/.claude.json` (distinct from `~/.claude/`) can carry MCP server configs with
  inline secrets. When `share.settings` is on, the wrapper stages it through `jq`, dropping
  `mcpServers[].env`, `mcpServers[].headers` and the legacy `primaryApiKey`; the non-secret
  structure (incl. server definitions) is kept. **Secure-fail:** if `jq` is missing or the
  file is invalid JSON, nothing is staged — hence `jq` is a wrapper `runtimeInput`. Verify:
  a fixture with an MCP env token + auth header + `primaryApiKey` → grep `seed/claude-json`
  for the secrets → zero hits, with `userID` + server name still present (`tests/host.sh` §1b).
  If a new secret-bearing key appears, add it to the `jq del(...)`.
- **`share.gitConfig` stages only sanitized, non-secret git config.** The wrapper resolves
  the **global** git config host-side and writes `seed/gitconfig` only after dropping every
  value containing `/nix/store/` and **all `credential.*` entries**, force-disabling commit/tag
  signing, and staging `core.excludesfile` by *content*. Keep all four guards. Verify by
  grepping the seed for any `/nix/store` path or `credential` key — expect zero hits.
- **No persistent disk.** Root is tmpfs; the store is a read-only image. Nothing the agent
  does survives exit except host-project edits while `writableCwd=true` — and, when the
  opt-in `persistClaudeProjects` is on, writes under `~/.claude/projects` (session transcripts
  + memory). Both are deliberate, narrowly-scoped write-throughs, not a general persistent disk.
  The opt-in `vmDiskSize` disk pool is **not** an exception: it is an *ephemeral* disk, wiped
  on exit. `/home` and root deliberately stay tmpfs, so secrets never go on the disk.
- **`vmDiskSize` pool: the LUKS key is guest-only, the disk is wiped on exit.** The host
  attaches a sparse image but **never** the key — the guest generates it from `/dev/urandom`
  in its own RAM and `luksFormat`s fresh every boot, so the host only ever sees ciphertext
  (verify: no key file in the seed; the wrapper writes only the `vm-disk` marker, never the
  key). Wipe-on-exit is cryptographic (key dies with guest RAM), with the trap `rm` as
  belt-and-suspenders. The host image MUST live in a disk-backed dir, never tmpfs/`$TMP`
  (that would put the "disk" back in RAM) — the wrapper refuses a tmpfs target unless
  `CCVM_SCRATCH_ALLOW_TMPFS=1`. The pool backs only **bulk, non-secret** data — `/scratch`
  and (with `nix.enable`) the writable `/nix/store` overlay upper, mounted in the **initrd**
  by a fail-open LUKS oneshot (key still guest-only). Keep `/home`/secrets in tmpfs. Never
  stage the key through the seed.
- **`writableCwd=false` means genuinely read-only.** The host tree is the 9p **lower**;
  edits land in a tmpfs **upper** and must not reach the host.
- **Only the CWD is shared.** No `~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, or home dir crosses the boundary.
- **QEMU is sandboxed; ccvm never runs as host root; 9p shares are `nosuid,nodev`.** QEMU
  launches with `-sandbox on,obsolete=deny,elevateprivileges=deny,spawn=deny,resourcecontrol=deny`
  so a device-emulation/9p/slirp escape hits a seccomp wall (`CCVM_QEMU_SANDBOX=0` is the
  escape hatch). The wrapper refuses host uid 0 — 9p `security_model=none` passthrough as root
  would let the guest create root-owned/setuid files on the host workspace (`CCVM_ALLOW_ROOT=1`
  overrides). Every 9p share is mounted `nosuid,nodev` (deliberately not `noexec` — the
  workspace needs to run project binaries/build scripts). Don't regress any of the three.

## Deliberate defaults — do not reverse

- **Native mirroring is the default.** `writableCwd=true` (live host edits),
  `share.*` allowlist on (settings/claudeMd/commands/agents/skills reuse host `~/.claude`), and
  `share.gitConfig=true` (commit as you, with your aliases/ignores) make ccvm behave like native
  `claude`. Isolation (read-only project, no config) is the **opt-in**. Do not re-propose "secure
  by default" — that was the original spec and was deliberately reversed.
- **RAM-only is the default; the disk pool and in-VM nix are opt-in.** `vmDiskSize=0` (no disk,
  pure RAM) and `nix.enable=false` (read-only `/nix/store`, no in-VM nix, lean closure) are the
  defaults. The user-facing option is `programs.ccvm.nix.enable`; the internal config + guest
  module use the same nested `nix.enable` name end to end. It is **build-time** — it flips
  `nix.enable` and rebuilds the store as a writable overlay in the initrd. Its overlay upper is
  tmpfs by default; combine with `vmDiskSize>0` and the initrd LUKS oneshot relocates that upper
  onto the encrypted disk (fail-open to tmpfs), so a large `nix develop` doesn't OOM guest RAM —
  one shared pool also backs `/scratch`. **The guest always boots off the self-contained squashfs
  store; the host store is never the guest's boot store.** To give in-VM nix extra pre-built
  paths, point it at a **binary cache** via `nix.substituters` + `nix.trustedPublicKeys` — pure
  guest-closure config, baked into the guest's nix.conf (appended to `cache.nixos.org` and
  nixpkgs' keys), HTTP substitution at line rate, no host credentials. `require-sigs` stays ON. A
  **public-read** signed cache works with zero secrets; a cache behind a token/netrc is **not yet
  supported**. Two predecessors were **deliberately removed — do not re-add**: `mountHostNixStore`
  (host store as the guest's boot store) and `nix.useHostStoreAsCache` (host `/nix/store`+DB over
  ro 9p as a local substituter): 9p copy ran **slower than downloading** (<1 MiB/s vs. network),
  and it exposed the *entire* host store to the agent.
- **`agentSudo` is auto, not a fixed default.** The agent has passwordless root in the guest
  EXCEPT when `egressAllowlist` is set, where it auto-drops so the in-guest egress firewall can't
  be flushed (the firewall is installed by a root systemd unit, not the agent). **Coupled to it
  (`guest/default.nix`): Nix `trusted-users` is gated on the SAME flag —
  `[ "root" ] ++ lib.optional cfg.agentSudo "ccvm"` — so when sudo is off the agent is also
  non-trusted. This is load-bearing under `nix.enable`: a Nix trusted-user is root-equivalent
  (a `post-build-hook` runs as root), so leaving the agent trusted would hand straight back the
  root the sudo-drop removes, letting it `nft flush` the firewall (audit S-1). A non-trusted
  agent can still `nix build`/`nix develop`; builds run as the nixbld users.** `null` = auto;
  `true`/`false` force it — but forcing `true` alongside an `egressAllowlist` re-opens the
  `nft flush` bypass (and re-grants trusted-user), so it's only sensible behind host-side egress
  control. Build-time (rebuilds the guest closure).
- **Guest kernel/userspace hardening is deliberate, cheap, and boot-safe (`guest/default.nix`).**
  In-guest defense-in-depth against an agent probing the kernel: **`security.protectKernelImage`**
  (no kexec/hibernation — *not* `lockKernelModules`, which would break the seed service's runtime
  `modprobe` of nf_tables/dm_crypt); **sysctls** `kptr_restrict=2`, `dmesg_restrict=1`,
  `unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1`, `bpf_jit_harden=2`, `rp_filter=1`; **`sudo-rs`** (memory-safe
  Rust sudo, `execWheelOnly`) in place of classic C sudo, still gated on `agentSudo`; an
  **explicit `root.hashedPassword = "!"`**; and a pinned **`nix.settings.allowed-users =
  [ "root" "ccvm" ]`**. Not done: `lockKernelModules` (incompatible with runtime modprobe) and
  disabling unprivileged user namespaces (the nix build sandbox needs them; namespaced-root can't
  reach the init-netns firewall — audit-verified, not a containment hole).
- **`extraClaudeMd` is default-on context, not a flag.** A built-in blurb is staged as the
  guest's `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (via the seed, **appended** to any host-shared one — never
  clobbering it) so the agent knows it's in ccvm. It must stay seed-delivered, never become
  `--append-system-prompt` (breaks transparent passthrough). The wrapper prepends a **runtime**
  mode line (rw=live / overlay=discarded) the build-time file can't know.
- **Transparent passthrough.** The wrapper injects **no** flags. Everything after `ccvm`
  is forwarded to `claude` verbatim, including `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. The *only*
  args the wrapper consumes are its own: `--shell`, `--ccvm-debug`, `--writable-cwd`,
  `--read-only-cwd`, `--ccvm-help`, `--ccvm-version` — all deliberately ccvm-specific names
  (none is a claude flag), so bare `--help`/`--version` still reach claude. Preserve that
  interception boundary.

- **Image paste — image-only reverse clipboard bridge (`clipboard.images`, default-on).**
  Claude Code reads pasted images by shelling out to `xclip`/`wl-paste`. The guest has no
  X/Wayland, so Ctrl+V image paste **silently no-ops** without the bridge. ccvm restores it
  over the existing SSH connection:
    1. **Guest shims.** Fake `xclip`/`wl-paste` (`guest/default.nix`, gated on
       `cfg.clipboard.images`) connect to `cfg.clipboard.port` (9180) on guest loopback, send
       a one-word request (`TARGETS`/`image/png`/`image/bmp`), and stream the reply to stdout.
    2. **Reverse tunnel.** The wrapper's `ssh -tt` adds `-R 127.0.0.1:9180:127.0.0.1:<hostport>`.
       sshd is `AllowTcpForwarding = "remote"` **pinned by `PermitListen 127.0.0.1:9180`** —
       exactly one reverse forward to one loopback port; no local/dynamic forwarding, and
       forwarding is client-requested so the agent can't set up its own.
    3. **Host server.** A `socat` listener (a wrapper `runtimeInput`) starts before connecting.
       Per request it runs the **host's** `wl-paste`/`xclip` for **image targets only**. The
       `case` arms are literal MIME types — a guest request can't widen to `text/*` or inject
       a command.

  **Why this doesn't weaken the boundary:** the bridge rides **loopback + the established SSH
  connection** (`oifname lo accept` + `ct state established`), punching **zero holes** in the
  egress firewall — a prompt-injected agent can't repurpose the one pinned forward. It is
  **image-only, enforced host-side** — the server never reads `text/plain`, shims never *write*
  the host clipboard — so host clipboard **text** (where passwords/tokens live) **never crosses**,
  making this strictly less exposure than native `claude`. Honest residual: under **open egress**
  a prompt-injected agent can *pull* any clipboard image at any time (pull-on-demand, not just on
  user paste) and exfiltrate it — same class as the project tree. Under hardened egress it can
  read the image but can't send it off-box. The bridge is **inert** when the host has no
  `wl-paste`/`xclip`. `CCVM_CLIPBOARD_IMAGES=0` only disables the wrapper-side wiring (can't
  conjure missing guest shims/sshd rule). The image-only guarantee is regression-tested against
  the **real** reader extracted from the wrapper (`tests/clipboard.sh`, the `clipboard` flake
  check) — no VM needed. macOS host is future.

## Why it's built this way (settled decisions — don't relitigate)

The rationale that used to live in `docs/design.md`. These were considered and decided;
reopening one needs a *new* reason, not a rediscovery of the old trade-off.

- **SSH transport, not the serial console — for PTY fidelity.** A serial line is not a
  terminal: no `SIGWINCH`, no window size, no full termios, so resize breaks and
  `vim`/`less`/full-screen TUIs corrupt. `ssh -tt` to a real sshd gives a genuine guest PTY
  that propagates `TERM`, window size, `SIGWINCH` on every resize, and termios end-to-end —
  so the VM is invisible. `-tt` *forces* PTY allocation even when the wrapper's own stdin isn't
  a tty. The wrapper runs ssh in the foreground but **never `exec`s it**, so it regains control
  to tear the VM down.
- **QEMU + slirp, not firecracker / cloud-hypervisor.** We need outbound HTTPS with **zero host
  setup** — no bridges, TAP devices, or `sudo`. QEMU's built-in slirp gives unprivileged
  user-mode NAT (guest 10.0.2.x, synthesised DNS+DHCP) plus `hostfwd` for the inbound SSH port.
  The lighter VMMs boot faster but require host networking setup, breaking "works on a stock box
  as a normal user." Boot speed matters; running unprivileged matters more.
- **Guest can reach the host's loopback via slirp `10.0.2.2` — know this.** slirp maps its
  gateway `10.0.2.2` to the *host's* `127.0.0.1`. Verified: from the guest, `10.0.2.2:22`
  answers with the **host's own sshd**. So under **open egress (the default) any host service
  bound to `127.0.0.1` is reachable from inside the VM** — local databases, unauth dashboards,
  model servers (e.g. Ollama on 11434), cloud metadata/credential proxies, a second ccvm — many
  unauthenticated *precisely because* they assume only host-local processes reach them. Network
  reach only, not a host-write path (fs boundary holds). An `egressAllowlist` closes it
  (`10.0.2.2` isn't in the set). There is **no slirp knob to keep internet but drop only the
  host redirect** (`restrict=on` kills both); the only complete fix is the host-side namespace
  under "Egress." Matters most when ccvm runs with sensitive loopback-bound services.
- **Egress: an allowlist, not Tor.** Tor solves *anonymity* (orthogonal — the API authenticates
  you by credential regardless; Tor adds latency and hits exit blocking; users wanting anonymity
  run it on the host and the guest rides it). Egress *control* belongs in ccvm;
  *anonymization* on the host.

  The IP-filter MVP has three residual channels: **FQDN staleness** (the kernel sees IPs, not
  names — ccvm pre-resolves allowlisted FQDNs host-side into a name→IP map (`egress-hosts`),
  written to the guest's `/etc/hosts` so the agent resolves each FQDN to exactly the IP the
  firewall allows; residual: a host that rotates every pinned IP away mid-session breaks —
  restart, or pin a CIDR for round-robin hosts); **DNS tunneling** (DNS is pinned to the slirp
  stub resolver, blocking DNS-to-anywhere, but low-bandwidth tunneling through the recursive
  resolver remains); **TCP-only** (QUIC/UDP 443 dropped; clients fall back to TCP).

  Load-bearing caveat: **enforcement lives in the guest**, so it only binds a non-root agent —
  a root agent could `nft flush` it. That's why `egressAllowlist` auto-drops `agentSudo` **and,
  under `nix.enable`, drops the agent from Nix `trusted-users`** (a trusted-user is
  root-equivalent via `post-build-hook`; audit S-1 demonstrated the bypass end-to-end, now
  closed). Together they raise the bar from one command to a guest-kernel exploit.

  The *complete* fix is **host-side egress enforcement**: put the allowlist nft in a namespace
  the guest can't reach, with a filtered uplink via `pasta`/`slirp4netns`. The uplink +
  filtering half is prototyped and works — but integrating it hit a hard **uid/caps/9p
  trilemma**: three constraints can't all hold in a plain *unprivileged* userns:
    * **nft needs `CAP_NET_ADMIN`** inside the namespace;
    * **9p `security_model=none`** needs QEMU's effective host uid to be the real user and the
      guest agent's uid to match;
    * **caps don't survive `execve` for a non-root uid.** `--map-current-user` (uid preserved
      → 9p OK) *loses* `CAP_NET_ADMIN` at execve — **verified: `nft` fails with "Operation not
      permitted"**. `--map-root` keeps caps but maps to uid 0, and **claude hard-refuses
      `--dangerously-skip-permissions` when euid==0** — **(b) is RULED OUT**. `--runas` can't
      bridge it.

  The only way out is **(a):** host `/etc/subuid` + `newuidmap` to map a uid *range* (holding
  both uid 0 for nft AND the real uid for QEMU/9p). Clean and correct, but requires **host
  setup** (against ccvm's zero-setup principle) and a delicate boot-path rework needing a human
  `--shell` pass. Net: host-side enforcement is only viable as (a), gated on host subuid setup.
  `agentSudo` is the shipped interim — it raises exfil from one command to a guest-kernel
  exploit; (a) raises it to a full QEMU escape, a marginal gain for real setup cost, so it stays
  opt-in/future. Don't re-attempt map-root.
- **Encrypted disk, not a plain ephemeral one.** Wipe-on-exit must survive a crash that skips
  the cleanup trap, and on modern storage plain deletion ≠ erasure (async SSD TRIM, CoW
  snapshots retain freed blocks). With FDE the key dies with guest RAM at power-off, so the
  image is inert ciphertext the instant QEMU stops — trap or no trap. The trap `rm` is
  belt-and-suspenders; the guarantee rests on the key being gone.
- **One encrypted pool, not a second `/nix/store` disk.** Once the disk is encrypted with a
  guest-RAM key, disk-vs-tmpfs makes no confidentiality difference to an in-guest attacker (it
  can read tmpfs or decrypt the disk equally). The right split is *bulk on the encrypted disk,
  secrets in tmpfs* — by **placement**, not a second disk. A second disk only earns its keep for
  a different lifecycle (persistent content-addressed store cache) — a separate future feature,
  deliberately **not** folded into `vmDiskSize`.
- **9p for the shares, not virtiofs (and the large-tree edge case).** The workspace/seed/config/
  projects shares ride virtio-9p — zero host daemon, unprivileged, zero setup. 9p with
  `cache=none` is latency-bound on *metadata*: each `stat`/`open`/`readdir` is a host round-trip,
  so a **cold whole-tree walk** is sluggish while the agent's normal localized loop feels native.
  Calibration: **systemd-scale (~4k files) is a non-issue; the Linux kernel (~85k files, ~1.5 GB)
  is the usable ceiling** — past that (100k+ tiny files) it crawls, but that isn't ccvm's user.
  The real-world worst case is a huge gitignored dir (`node_modules`/`.venv`/`target`): `rg`/`fd`
  skip gitignored paths; bulk build output belongs on `/scratch`. **virtiofs is a deliberate
  non-goal pre-1.0:** it needs a per-share `virtiofsd` daemon + shared-memory guest backend
  (reworking core QEMU `-m` args, the cleanup trap, and the uid-remap/`security_model=none` path)
  — a multi-day change that reopens every share's security verification, for a problem the audience
  rarely hits. Cheap lever: bump 9p `msize` and add a mode-aware cache (`cache=loose`/`mmap` is
  fine for the ro overlay lower/config/seed, but risks stale reads on the live rw workspace).
  Don't reach for virtiofs without that benchmark first.
- **`claude-code` comes from a community flake; nixpkgs is pinned stable.** nixpkgs is pinned to
  the **stable release (`nixos-26.05`)**, not `nixos-unstable`. The old reason for unstable —
  tracking a fast-moving `claude-code` — no longer applies: `claude-code` now comes from the
  **community `github:ryoppippi/nix-claude-code` flake** (input `claude-code`, `follows` our
  nixpkgs). Its `overlays.default` sets `pkgs.claude-code`, so every existing `pkgs.claude-code`
  reference (`lib/defaults.nix`, `guest/default.nix`) transparently picks up the community build,
  kept current independent of the nixpkgs channel. **It only reaches a home-manager consumer
  because `modules/home-manager.nix` closes over the `claude-code` input and applies the overlay
  to the consumer's own `pkgs`** (`pkgs.extend`) — a downstream flake has no view of our inputs
  otherwise; keep that wiring. The package is still **unfree** (pname `claude`, not `claude-code` —
  so an `allowUnfreePredicate` must match `"claude"`) and its FOD still downloads the prebuilt
  binary from `storage.googleapis.com` (see the hardened-egress note above).
- **No published binary cache (first-run stays a local build).** Most of the guest closure
  substitutes from `cache.nixos.org`, so first-run is bounded — mostly download + the
  ccvm-specific squashfs/toplevel build (~minutes). The **unfree** `claude-code` path is not on
  `cache.nixos.org`, and re-serving it from a public cache is a redistribution problem. Net:
  bounded win, licensing headache. Don't re-propose a public cache without a new reason; if
  first-run ever hurts, shrink the closure.

## Build / test / debug

- Build the wrapper: `nix build .#ccvm`. **Iteration cost:** `memory`/`cores` are runtime
  QEMU args (cheap, no rebuild); changing `package`/`extraPackages`/`nix.enable`/guest
  modules rebuilds the guest closure.
- **Iterate fast with a stub `claude`** — the proven way to test file/config/arg behaviour
  without a real agent run. Bake a shell script as the `package` and assert on its stdout:

  ```nix
  (import ./lib/mkccvm.nix { inherit pkgs; } {
    package = pkgs.writeShellScriptBin "claude" ''
      # print what the guest sees: mount type of $HOME/.claude, is settings.json
      # readable, does it contain the expected model, is .credentials.json present, …
    '';
  }).wrapper
  ```

  Boot it under `tcg`/`q35`, grep the output. This is exactly how `share.*` and
  `writableCwd` were verified end-to-end — much faster than booting the real agent.
- `nix flake check` should pass — and is **warning-clean**. It builds the guest image, shellchecks
  the wrapper, and runs `tests/host.sh` (the `checks.<sys>.host` derivation) — host-side secret
  hygiene, config staging, verbatim argv, mode selection — against the real wrapper driven by its
  `CCVM_DRYRUN` hook (no VM, no claude-code). Both former "unknown flake output" warnings were real,
  avoidable naming issues (not cosmetic): the home-manager module is exposed as **`homeModules`**
  (the name stock Nix recognizes — `homeManagerModules` warns, verified on Nix 2.34.7; don't
  reintroduce it), and the `ccvmParts` catch-all is gone. Buildable guest artifacts are honest
  packages: `nix build .#guest-store` (ro squashfs store) or `.#guest-toplevel` (system closure).
  The non-derivation bring-up handles (`append`, the evaluated `guestSystem`) are deliberately
  **not** flake outputs; introspect them with a direct import — e.g. dump any guest config value:

  ```bash
  nix eval --impure --expr 'let p = (builtins.getFlake (toString ./.)).inputs.nixpkgs.legacyPackages.x86_64-linux;
    in (import ./lib/mkccvm.nix { pkgs = p; } { nix.enable = true; egressAllowlist = ["x"]; }).guestSystem.config.nix.settings.trusted-users'
  ```
- **Rebuilding the guest from inside a hardened-egress ccvm needs `storage.googleapis.com`.** Any
  build that re-realizes the guest closure — `nix flake check`'s `guest-image`/`wrapper` checks,
  `tests/boot.nix`, or `nix build .#ccvm` — must fetch the **unfree** `claude-code`, whose
  fixed-output derivation downloads from `storage.googleapis.com` (deliberately never on a binary
  cache — see "No published binary cache"). That host is NOT in a typical `egressAllowlist`, so
  from *inside* a hardened ccvm such a build hangs, then fails with
  `cannot download claude from any mirror` — the egress firewall doing its job, not a bug. Add
  `storage.googleapis.com` to the allowlist when you need to rebuild ccvm in-VM. The host-side
  checks (`checks.<sys>.{host,egress}`) don't pull claude-code and build fine under any egress
  posture.
- **Full-boot smoke test:** `bash tests/boot.sh` (defaults to `CCVM_ACCEL=tcg
  CCVM_MACHINE=q35`) boots a stub-`claude` VM and asserts argv-reaches-claude and overlay
  vs. rw file visibility.
- **Boot-testing without working KVM:** force software emulation with
  `CCVM_ACCEL=tcg CCVM_MACHINE=q35 ccvm` (slow but correct).
- `CCVM_DEBUG=1` / `--ccvm-debug` streams the guest console and keeps the scratch dir.
  `CCVM_SHELL=1` / `--shell` drops into a guest zsh instead of claude.
- **Terminal fidelity is human-verified**, not automated (`ccvm --shell`, then resize /
  vim / less / vi-mode). Don't claim it works from code inspection alone.
- **Definition of done for a behaviour change:** `nix flake check` green **and** a
  stub-package boot test asserting the new behaviour under `tcg`/`q35` — plus a human
  `--shell` pass if it touches the TTY.
- **aarch64-linux is best-effort.** It evaluates and is wired up (`qemu-system-aarch64`, the
  `virt` machine, PL011 `ttyAMA0` console), but x86_64-linux is the primary, CI-built target.

## Conventions

- **Commit automatically once all checks pass when working through a task list.** When working a
  multi-step task, run the relevant checks (`bash -n`, the `host.sh` dry-run recipe, and — on a
  Nix+KVM box — `nix flake check` / `bash tests/boot.sh` / a `--shell` pass for TTY changes); if
  they're green, commit without stopping to ask per item. Still surface anything that can only be
  verified on the Nix+KVM box so it gets checked there before being claimed done.
- **Don't touch `README.md` without an explicit go-ahead.** The user owns the README. Propose
  changes (even a one-word fix to a dangling reference) and wait for an explicit OK before
  editing it — unlike the rest of the tree, it is not auto-fixable under the commit-on-green rule.
- **Audience split — write to the right altitude.** The README is **newcomer-facing**:
  approachable, for people new to ccvm and non-technical evaluators. **CLAUDE.md is for the
  technical reader** — security nuts, contributors — and is where the deep detail, threat-model
  nuance, edge cases, and settled-decision rationale live. When something surfaces, put the
  friendly version (if any) in the README and the real depth here, not the other way round.
- **Commit trailer (exact):** `Co-authored-by: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>` — lowercase
  `authored-by`, bare `Claude`, no model name. This intentionally differs from the Claude
  Code CLI default; use *this* form.
- **Config flows through `@TOKENS@`.** Scalars are baked at build time in `mkccvm.nix`
  (`@MODE@` = `rw`/`overlay`, `@SHARE_SETTINGS@`/`@SHARE_CLAUDEMD@`/`@SHARE_COMMANDS@`/
  `@SHARE_AGENTS@`/`@SHARE_SKILLS@`/`@SHARE_PLUGINS@`/`@SHARE_CONFIG@` = `1`/`0`, etc.).
  Values only known at launch — the workspace 9p share and SSH port — are **not** baked;
  the wrapper builds those QEMU args at runtime (the microvm.nix "runtime-share trap").
- **Runtime override pattern:** a `CCVM_*` env var overrides the baked default for one run
  (`CCVM_WRITABLE_CWD`, `CCVM_SHARE_SETTINGS`, `CCVM_SHARE_CLAUDEMD`, `CCVM_SHARE_COMMANDS`,
  `CCVM_SHARE_AGENTS`, `CCVM_SHARE_SKILLS`, `CCVM_SHARE_PLUGINS`, `CCVM_SHARE_CONFIG`,
  `CCVM_MLOCK`, `CCVM_ACCEL`); an explicit `ccvm` flag wins over the env var.
  Back-compat: `CCVM_SHARE_CLAUDE_CONFIG=0|1` toggles all claude items at once; per-item
  vars win over it.
- **`acceleration` is a declarative mode, baked as `@ACCELERATION@` (`auto`/`kvm`/`tcg`).**
  `auto` (default) uses KVM when `/dev/kvm` is usable else falls back to TCG, using `-cpu max`
  (not `host`) so QEMU's own `-accel kvm:tcg` runtime fallback stays valid. `kvm` requires KVM:
  hard-errors with an actionable reason (missing device / not in `kvm` group / not writable) and
  uses `-accel kvm` (no fallback) + `-cpu host`. `tcg` forces emulation. Per-run: `CCVM_ACCEL`.
  The boot-wait budget is generous for anything that might run emulated. The KVM-usability probe
  only checks the device is writable (can't detect a present-but-broken KVM) — a real
  `KVM_CREATE_VM` failure surfaces as QEMU's error (`kvm` mode) or a silent TCG fallback (`auto`).
  Tests drive modes via `CCVM_KVM_DEV` to simulate `/dev/kvm` states portably.
- **Forwarded argv is NUL-separated** on the wire (`claude-args` in the seed, read with
  `mapfile -d ""`); spaces/quotes/globs survive intact. Never rebuild the argv by
  string-splitting.
- **Nix `''` string escaping** (wrapper + guest scripts are inside `''…''`): a literal bash
  `${var}` is written `''${var}`; `$(...)` and bare `$var` pass through literally.
- `wrapper/ccvm.sh` is built via `writeShellApplication`, so **shellcheck runs at build** —
  keep it clean (and the `set -euo pipefail` it injects in mind).

## Gotchas (expensive to rediscover)

- **9p preserves symlinks verbatim.** A host symlink pointing outside the exported tree
  (home-manager links `~/.claude/settings.json` → `/nix/store/…`) **dangles** in the guest.
  Fix already in place: dereference such links host-side into the seed, then lay the real
  files over the config overlay's tmpfs upper (shadowing the dead lower symlink).
- **Overlay copy-up hazard.** Never `chown -R` an overlay root — it copies *every* lower
  file up into the tmpfs upper. Chown only the specific files you staged.
- **microvm vs q35 use different virtio transports** (`virtio-mmio`/BUS=`device` vs
  `virtio-pci`/BUS=`pci`). The wrapper derives `BUS` from the machine type; keep new
  `-device` args going through it.
- **`ssh -tt` adds a PTY**, so guest stdout gets `\r` and escape sequences. When grepping
  captured guest output, use `grep -a` and `tr -d '\r'` or matches silently fail.
- **The guest interactive shell is zsh, which has no `/dev/tcp`.** Any in-guest TCP-connect probe
  (egress checks against the allowlist, the clipboard-bridge `127.0.0.1:9180` reader — e.g. the
  ones in `tests/security-reverification.md`) relies on bash's `/dev/tcp` pseudo-device; under the
  guest's zsh it fails with `no such file or directory` and *falsely* reads as BLOCKED/dead. Wrap
  such probes in `bash -c`. Test artifact only — the real clipboard shims are bash scripts
  (`writeShellScriptBin`), so they hit `/dev/tcp` fine.
- **9p `msize` is negotiated DOWN.** `guest/launcher.nix` requests `msize=1048576` (1 MiB), but
  QEMU's virtio-9p caps the *effective* value (≈`512000` in practice — `grep msize /proc/mounts`).
  Harmless, but don't trust the requested number when reasoning about 9p throughput.
- **`vmDiskSize` adds ~4–5s to boot — the encrypted disk's device-settle + per-boot `luksFormat`.**
  Measured baselines under KVM (8 vCPU / 8 GiB): a full boot is ~7.3s (≈277ms kernel + 3.9s
  initrd + 3.1s userspace); `systemd-analyze blame`'s top units are the `vdb` /
  `virtio-ccvm-scratch` device settling at ~4.6s — the undeclared scratch disk waiting on
  `udevadm settle` plus the initrd LUKS-format. The pure-RAM default (`vmDiskSize=0`) boots
  faster; this cost is **inherent to the wipe-on-exit guarantee** (a fresh `luksFormat` every
  boot, by design), not a regression. Other measured references: **warm 9p is a non-issue**
  (768-file repo walk ≈70ms, `git status` ≈100ms); a **running session sits around ~0.7–0.8 GiB
  RAM** because the squashfs store and writable-store overlay upper live on the encrypted disk.
